# DotSync

This is my collection of dotfiles to sync and customize my work environment.

## Description

These are the dotfiles I use to customize my KDE environment and my development tools. The configuration is designed to be easily synchronized across different systems.

### Configurations for:

- **vim/nvim** (text editor):
  - `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
- **zsh** (shell):
  - `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc`
- **KDE** (desktop environment):
  - All my customization preferences are in `~/.local/share/`

### Repository Structure

I try to minimize whatâ€™s directly in `~`:

- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are there.
- Some environment variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`.


## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to be used with the following programs:

- **KDE Plasma desktop environment**
